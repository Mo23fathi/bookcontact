# CLI BookContact Searching and Sorting System
This Java project implements a Command Line Interface (CLI) BookContact searching and sorting system using various data structures. The system provides functionalities to manage a collection of contacts efficiently, including searching, sorting, and managing contacts.

Features
Searching Contacts: Utilize efficient searching algorithms to find contacts by name, phone number, or other attributes.
Sorting Contacts: Implement sorting algorithms to organize contacts alphabetically or based on specified criteria.
Data Structures: Utilize various data structures such as AVL tree, Heap, Queue, and 2-4 Tree to manage contacts efficiently.
Modular Design: The project is organized into several Java files, each responsible for a specific data structure or functionality, promoting modularity and maintainability.
Code Timer: Includes a CodeTimer class for benchmarking and measuring the performance of different operations and algorithms.
